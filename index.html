<h1> Who Am I! </h1>
<div>
<p class="paragraph"> Lightly built and darkly decorated I am. Although light, I don't possess any extremities. Does that make me sound healthy? All I know is, I am being able to carry on till now. Absence of physical challenges in my life should be as well credited for my well-being. I believe, upon need, I certainly can do enough not to be corpse already. So, am I arrogant and proud enough to predict victory over a situation never encountered before? </p>


<p>Even if I am, I try to limit these things to myself as far as practicable. That for once should make me experimental on approach. My experiments more often than not lead to easy approach upon stuffs in life. Sounds like success, doesn't it? Certainly a success, but as small as it gets; only an act for me, though, which leads to nothing! </p>

<p>A touch of dark is printed and modeled over me. Many credit so called and truly theirs God for it. For me, it is just another asset I have of no significance. Although it is what most people judge each other upon, I have no regret whatsoever! So, does that make me ill-minded?</p>

<h1> My fluctuating Desire </h1>

<div><p class = "paragraph" >What did I not dream of becoming? From foreseeing the sight where I gained extra weight followed by a belly as a businessman to the aspirations of being a doctor, I have had it all! Glancing back at past, I have had fluctuating ambitions over the years that has seen me have change in my prospective as well. </p>
<p>Childhood of mine initiated as I wished to be a pilot. All I knew at that stage was that pilots get the pleasure of flying and hence ruling sky. A beautiful dream and aspiration, it was! I, as a child, never got too serious about my dream, though! For me, the unexplored and never visited sky lured me to being a pilot someday in future. </p>
<p> Back then, neither did job placement percentage nor could pay rate influence my desire to pursue my career as a pilot. To add, I as well didnâ€™t have any knowledge what-so-ever as to what I had to be good at to being the one I dreamt of. </p>
